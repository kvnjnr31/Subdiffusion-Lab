# Subdiffusion-Lab
A physics-informed simulation framework for modeling bacteriophage-bacteria encounters in mucosal environments. Combines Lattice Boltzmann fluid dynamics, agent-based motion, and a novel Tail-Integrated Grid-Embedded Rigid-body (TIGER) model to quantify hydrodynamic enhancement and subdiffusive constraints on adsorption rates.
